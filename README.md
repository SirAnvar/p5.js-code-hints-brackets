# p5.js code hints for brackets code editor

  This is a very early version so might not include everything. At the moment if you have JavaScript hints enabled
  this will apper not to work, a work around for this is to disable JavaScript hints in default extensions and to then
  re-enable it, this should work for now, though I will work to bring a better solution.
